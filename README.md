# TBFIT
Tight-binding FITting package (temporary name)

TBFIT is a scientific Fortran program for numerical tight-binding parameter fitting mainly based on Slater-Koster scheme and tight-binding calculations for the electronic band structures of given atomic and electronic configurations with an simple input interfaces. You can taste how TBFIT works and its performance in Example section. TBFIT allows you also to calculate various Berry phase related quantities, such as Berry curvature, Zak phase, Wilson's loop, first Chern number, and so on. TBFIT can fit Slater-Koster parameters including scaling factors to your target first-principles band structure.

In the future release, I will add some routines for the Green function approach to get the surface state (or edge spectrum as well) and the routines for the spin/mirror Chern number evaluation within the given tight-binding parameter and model hamiltonian.

For the details and examples you can find documents that describes the input tags in /MANUAL/ folder and several input/output files in EXAMPLE/ folder, respectively.
